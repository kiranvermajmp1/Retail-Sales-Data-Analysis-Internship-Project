# Retail-Sales-Data-Analysis-Internship-Project
This is a project given to us by Internship Studio.
# Project Description
The aim of this project is to use Python, SQL, and Excel to analyze sales
data and generate meaningful reports for a retail chain.
# Steps Involved in the Project
**Phase 1: Data Collection and Database Setup**
**1.Data Collection:** Download the data from Kaggle as a csv file and
place it on the proper path
**2.Database Setup:** Set up a SQL database to hold the data. Design
the database schema, and create the necessary tables using SQL
DDL commands.
**Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation**
**1. Data Cleaning:** Use SQL queries and Python (pandas) to clean the
data. Look for and handle missing or inconsistent data, outliers, etc.
**2. Data Preparation:** Prepare the data for analysis. This may involve
creating additional calculated fields, such as total sales value,
month/year fields for time-based analysis, etc. Again, this can be done
using a combination of SQL and Python.
**Phase 3: Data Analysis**
**1. Data Exploration:** Use SQL queries and Python (pandas, matplotlib,
seaborn, etc) to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.
**2. Advanced Analysis:** Perform more complex analysis as needed. For
example, time series analysis for sales trends, cohort analysis for
customer behavior, etc. Python's advanced data analysis libraries can
be very useful here.
**Phase 4: Reporting**
**1. Report Preparation:** Prepare reports summarizing the findings. These can include:
• **Tabular Reports:** Create summary tables showing sales by product, store, month, etc. These
can be generated using SQL queries and Python, and then formatted and presented in Excel.
• **Visual Reports:** Create visual reports (charts, graphs, etc) showing trends and patterns. These
can be created using Python's data visualization libraries, and then incorporated into Excel for
presentation.
